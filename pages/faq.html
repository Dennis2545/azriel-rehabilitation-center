     <h4>What is pychological disorder?</h4>
     <span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span>  
   </summary>
   <p> A psychological disorder is, broadly, a condition characterized by distressing, impairing, and/or atypical thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their symptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are  atypical in the sense that they indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner experience can easily be labeled as distressing, impairing, or atypical and more clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. A person who feels compelled to wash their hands 40 times per day or a person who claims to hear the voices of demons exhibits behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as atypical and impairing, if not distressing: beliefs and behaviors that suggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness someone may feel when giving a speech or the loneliness  a freshman may experience during the first semester of college—these feelings are not unusual, and it may be difficult to determine when these experiences can be categorized as appropriate nervousness or sadness compared with clinically significant anxiety or depression. So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder?</p>
